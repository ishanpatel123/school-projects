# Projects and details
 - ASP.NET:
   1. Soft Eng I - Group Project: A comprehensive web application featuring user authentication, role-based access control, dynamic content presentation, interactive assessment forms, email scheduling and notifications, report generation, team/product information, and customizable branding.
   2. Soft Eng II - Group Project: The system allows individuals to register, unregister, reset passwords, log in, create, view, reassign, accept/reject, mark complete, delete, update to-do items, view pending items, and view item details.

      
 - Assembly Language:
   1. Project 1: The application efficiently gathers user input until the enter key is pressed, providing informative error messages for invalid characters and excessive digit counts, while subsequently performing calculations for the largest positive/negative dword, word, and byte.
   2. Project 2: The program restricts user input to a maximum of 10 characters per word and allows for a maximum of 10 words. Upon the user hitting the enter key, it computes the sum of all entered words and displays both the words and their total sum as the output.
   3. Project 3: The program get string(s) and either compare them or convert it to lowercase and uppercase.
   4. Project 4: The progeam convert ascii characters input to the numeric value.
   5. Project 5: The program gets student's grades and completed hours and output GPA and classification of it(senior, junior, etc..).
   6. Project 6: The application employs binary trees to perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals, while also managing a binary tree to maintain an increasing order during traversal.

      
 - C#:
   1. Algorithms Project 1: This application, ConvexHull, specializes in computational geometry, implementing and visualizing convex hull algorithms for efficient point set enclosures.
   2. Algorithms Project 2: Similar to project1 ^, but Convex Hull using Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
   3. Algorithms Project 3: This program calculate factorial for big integer using uint class.
   4. Algorithms Project 4: This program efficiently processes files containing strings by dynamically allocating memory based on the specified heap size. It divides the strings into temporary files according to the allocated heap size, continuously sorting and merging them into a single output file.
   5. Data Structure Project 1: This application gathers and validate credit card information.
   6. Data Structure Project 2: This application facilitates the management of a collection of CreditCards, enabling users to perform actions on them and store them within an indexed CreditCard List for efficient retrieval and organization.
   7. Data Structure Project 3: This application seamlessly converts infix expressions to postfix notation while enhancing the presentation of the resulting string for improved readability and aesthetic appeal.

      
 - C++:
   1. 3D game - Project 1: This application creates a game(2d) in openGL, which renders tile at specified position with background.
   2. 3D game - Project 2: It's same above game application, but it renders line and tringles to create simple graphics.
   3. 3D game - Project 3: This application creates a game(3d) in openGL, with characters and behaviours such as patrol, back and forth, etc.
   4. 3D game - Project 4: It's same above game(3d) application, but it have bird flying, toy car is being driven in a room.

      
 - HTML:
   - This application showcases top-tier websites designed for purchasing Nintendo Mario games, boasting visually stunning graphics to enhance user experience and engagement.

     
 - Java:
   1. 1250 - Project 1: This application provides users with detailed step tracking metrics, presenting step counts over varying time intervals including minutes, hours, days, and years. Additionally, it offers conversion and display of step data into feet and miles over a span of 20 years.
   2. 1250 - Project 2: This Java program efficiently calculates tip amounts based on user input, offering a menu of options including custom tip percentages, while also incorporating methods for clear screen functionality, user prompt continuation, and output formatting for enhanced usability.
   3. 1250 - Project 3: This application utilizes a writing method to present the GPA calculated from the average of three grades entered by the user.
   4. 1250 - Project 4: This Java program utilizes methods, information, and calculated data from the BookOrder class to display formatted output, leveraging utility class methods for enhanced presentation.
   5. 1250 - Project 5: The purpose of this Java program is to utilize methods, information, and calculated data from the Adviser class, presenting it via JOptionPane dialogs, and incorporating methods from Project 5 to offer user-selectable choices for accurate results.
   6. 1260 - Project 1: This application is build with  Java Swing library to store photographs in files and calculating cost per pixfiles storage.
   7. 1260 - Project 2: Enhance the Project1 design to include management of an ArrayList of Pixfiles, presenting users with options for selection.
   8. 1260 - Project 3: Enhance the Project1 design to include search photographer name, sort Pixfiles, display smallest and largest files by its size.
   9. 1260 - Project 4: A text based monster hunting game with stick, swords and weapons. Eack of them hold different points to kill monster(s).
   10. 1260 - Project 5: Enhance the Project1 design to have slideshow for Pixfiles including its metadata.

       
 - Unity:
   1. Beep Jump: An immersive platform-based game requiring players to navigate forward while evading obstacles.
